# The Assess-Decide-Do Framework

AIGernon is built on the ADD cognitive framework — a model for understanding how humans think and make decisions.

## The Three Realms

Human cognition flows through three distinct modes:

### ASSESS (Red)

**The realm of exploration.**

- Evaluate options without commitment
- Dream, wonder, explore "what if"
- Gather information, consider possibilities
- No pressure to decide

**Language patterns:**
- "I've been thinking about..."
- "What if we..."
- "I'm wondering whether..."
- "Exploring the possibility of..."

**AIGernon's response:** Expansive. Offers possibilities. Asks "what else?" not "what next?"

### DECIDE (Yellow)

**The realm of commitment.**

- Prioritize among options
- Allocate resources (time, energy, money)
- Make commitments
- Brief, values-based choices

**Language patterns:**
- "I've decided to..."
- "I'm going to..."
- "My priority is..."
- "I'm committing to..."

**AIGernon's response:** Honors the weight of choosing. Supports commitment. Keeps it brief.

### DO (Green)

**The realm of execution.**

- Take action on commitments
- Complete tasks
- Create "livelines" (not deadlines)
- Ship, deliver, finish

**Language patterns:**
- "I'm working on..."
- "Just finished..."
- "Completed the..."
- "Shipping today..."

**AIGernon's response:** Clear and actionable. Celebrates completions as new starting points.

## The Cascade Principle

> Poor Assess → Poor Decide → Poor Do

Each realm builds on the previous:

1. **Without proper Assess**, you don't understand your options
2. **Without proper Decide**, you don't know what to execute
3. **Without proper Do**, nothing ships

This is why rushing through Assess (or skipping it entirely) leads to poor outcomes. The quality of your execution depends on the quality of your exploration and commitment.

## Imbalance Detection

AIGernon watches for cognitive imbalances:

### Stuck in Assess (Analysis Paralysis)

**Signs:**
- Endless research without decision
- "I need more information before..."
- Circular exploration of the same options
- Fear of commitment disguised as thoroughness

**AIGernon's intervention:** Gentle recognition. "You've explored this thoroughly. What would you need to decide?"

### Stuck in Decide (Commitment Avoidance)

**Signs:**
- Decisions without action
- Repeated re-prioritization
- "I've decided, but first..."
- Plans that never execute

**AIGernon's intervention:** Support the doing. "You decided last week. What's the first concrete step?"

### Stuck in Do (Perpetual Doing)

**Signs:**
- Constant busyness without reflection
- No time to assess new options
- Executing outdated decisions
- Burnout from action without pause

**AIGernon's intervention:** Create space. "You've been executing hard. What would you assess if you paused?"

## Realm Flow Tracking

AIGernon logs realm transitions in daily memory:

```markdown
## 2024-02-10 Realm Flow

- 09:15 ASSESS - career options
- 09:32 DECIDE - committed to applying
- 10:45 DO - working on portfolio
- 14:20 ASSESS - exploring presentation styles
- 15:30 DO - writing slides

## Summary: 30% Assess, 10% Decide, 60% Do
```

Over time, patterns emerge:
- "User tends to skip Decide on personal decisions"
- "High Assess percentage on Tuesdays (planning day)"
- "Low Do on financial topics — possible avoidance"

---

## ADD in Practice

### For Individuals

Use ADD to notice where you're spending cognitive energy:

1. **Morning:** Mostly Assess (planning, considering)
2. **Midday:** Mostly Do (executing, meeting)
3. **Evening:** Review — did you Decide enough?

### For Teams

ADD creates shared vocabulary:

- "Let's stay in Assess for this meeting — no commitments"
- "We need to Decide by Friday"
- "This week is pure Do — no new exploration"

### For Projects

Map project phases to realms:

- **Discovery:** Assess realm
- **Planning:** Decide realm
- **Execution:** Do realm
- **Retrospective:** Back to Assess

## Integration with AIGernon

### Implicit Detection

AIGernon detects your realm without you stating it:

```
You: "Should I take the job offer?"
AIGernon: [Detects ASSESS] "What factors are you weighing?"

You: "I've decided to take it."
AIGernon: [Detects DECIDE] "Congratulations. What's your first step?"

You: "Writing my resignation letter now."
AIGernon: [Detects DO] "Good momentum. Need help with the wording?"
```

### Explicit Realm Setting

You can also set realm explicitly:

```
You: "Let's just explore options for the website redesign. No decisions today."
AIGernon: [Sets ASSESS mode] "Got it. What aspects are you curious about?"
```

### Memory and Patterns

AIGernon maintains awareness of your realm patterns:

- Time spent in each realm
- Transitions between realms
- Stuck patterns over time
- Topic-specific tendencies
