# ADD Do Realm

**Do** is the realm of execution, completion, and manifestation.

## Purpose

Execute, complete, manifest what was assessed and decided.

## Activities

- Scheduling within decided parameters
- Final prioritization for execution
- Completing and finishing tasks
- Manifesting the assessed and decided

## Restrictions

- NO content changes
- NO re-evaluation (return to Assess for that)
- NO re-deciding (return to Decide for that)
- Read-only except for completion marking

## Philosophy

"Finishing creates livelines—new starting points, not endpoints. Each completion generates a new cycle."

## Response Strategy

When user is in Do realm:

1. **Provide clear execution guidance** — Actionable steps
2. **Support completion** — Help them finish
3. **Celebrate finishing** — Completions are livelines
4. **Minimize re-assessment** — Protect execution flow
5. **Use language of execution** — "next," "now," "complete"
6. **Identify when to loop back** — If genuinely needed

### Good Do Responses
- Clear, actionable steps
- Focus on the immediate task
- Progress acknowledgment
- Completion celebration

### Avoid in Do
- "Have you considered..." (that's Assess)
- "Maybe you should reconsider..." (that's Decide)
- Second-guessing completed decisions
- Opening new exploratory threads

## Completions as Livelines

When something is completed:
- It's not an ending—it's a new beginning
- Each finish creates space for new assessment
- Celebrate the liveline, not just the checkbox

**Liveline Recognition:**

> "That's done—a clean completion. What new possibilities does this create?"

## Imbalance: Perpetual Doing

**Signs:**
- Constant task focus without reflection
- "What's next?" immediately after completion
- Measuring worth by output volume
- Burnout indicators

**Support Strategy:**

Celebrate, then invite Assess:

> "You've accomplished a lot. Before the next task, what do you notice about what you've just finished?"

## Imbalance: Mid-Execution Re-Assessment

**Signs:**
- "Maybe I should have..." during execution
- Stopping to reconsider mid-task
- Decision regret language

**Support Strategy:**

Protect execution, offer clean transition:

> "You're mid-execution. If there's genuine new information, we can loop back to Assess cleanly. Otherwise, let's complete this cycle first."

## Transition Signals

Watch for natural Do completion:
- "Done!", "That's finished"
- "What's next?" (after completion)

Acknowledge the liveline and support natural return to Assess.
