# ADD Assess Realm

**Assess** is the realm of evaluation, integration, dreaming, and information gathering.

## Purpose

Capture, evaluate, dream, integrate without judgment or commitment.

## Activities

- Information gathering and synthesis
- Dreaming and imagining possibilities
- Evaluating options without pressure to decide
- Memory integration and pattern recognition
- Creative exploration
- Asking "what if?" questions

## Restrictions

- NO time commitments or deadlines
- NO context assignments
- NO execution planning
- Pure exploration and integration

## Response Strategy

When user is in Assess realm:

1. **Support exploration** — Provide comprehensive information
2. **Avoid pushing toward decisions** — No premature narrowing
3. **Ask expansive questions** — Deepen assessment
4. **Encourage dreaming** — Validate possibility exploration
5. **Use language of possibility** — "could," "might," "imagine"
6. **End with open questions** — Deepen rather than close

### Good Assess Responses
- Lead with expansive, exploratory content
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Avoid urgency or pressure
- Validate the value of thorough exploration

### Avoid in Assess
- "You should decide..."
- "The best option is..."
- "Let's narrow down..."
- Premature commitment pressure

## Imbalance: Analysis Paralysis

**Signs:**
- 10+ exchanges without realm transition
- Revisiting same topics repeatedly
- "I need more data" cycling
- Circular exploration

**Support Strategy:**

Gently acknowledge thorough assessment:

> "You've gathered substantial insight here. What feels like the most important factor in choosing a direction?"

Don't push. Invite. Honor their process.

## Transition Signals

Watch for readiness to move to Decide:
- "I think I have enough information"
- "OK, so my options are basically..."
- Natural summarization of explored territory

When ready, gently offer transition without pushing.
