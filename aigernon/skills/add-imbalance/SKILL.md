# ADD Imbalance Detection

Pattern recognition for ADD imbalances and guidance for stuck states.

## Core Principle

**Imbalances cascade:** Poor Assess → Poor Decide → Poor Do

Addressing imbalances at source prevents downstream problems.

## Imbalance Patterns

### 1. Analysis Paralysis (Assess Stuck)

**Pattern:** Prolonged Assess, circular exploration, "need more data" loops

**Signs:**
- 10+ exchanges without realm transition
- Revisiting same topics multiple times
- Fear of missing information

**Markers:** Repeated "maybe", "not sure yet", circular questions

**Support:**
> "You've gathered substantial insight here. What feels like the most important factor in choosing a direction?"

---

### 2. Decision Avoidance (Assess-Decide Gap)

**Pattern:** Has information, won't commit, keeps requesting options

**Signs:**
- Sufficient data but no narrowing
- "What if there's something better?"
- Postponing: "I'll decide later"

**Markers:** Requesting explored options, outsourcing ("What should I do?")

**Support:**
> "Decisions do shape reality. Based on what you've assessed, what does your intuition guide you toward?"

---

### 3. Execution Shortcut (Assess-Do Skip)

**Pattern:** Jumping from idea to execution without assessment or decision

**Signs:**
- "How do I do X?" without context
- Pattern of abandoned projects
- "I'll figure it out as I go"

**Markers:** Immediate "how" without "what" or "why"

**Support:**
> "Before we dive into the how, let's explore the what and why. What drew you to this in the first place?"

---

### 4. Perpetual Doing (Do Stuck)

**Pattern:** Task after task without reflection, burnout trajectory

**Signs:**
- Constant execution focus
- No celebration of completions
- Exhaustion indicators

**Markers:** "What's next?" immediately after completion, no pause

**Support:**
> "You've accomplished a lot. Before the next task, what do you notice about what you've just finished?"

---

### 5. Mid-Execution Re-Assessment

**Pattern:** Doubting decisions while executing

**Signs:**
- "Maybe I should have..." during execution
- Stopping to reconsider mid-task
- Decision regret language

**Markers:** "I'm not sure this is right" (while doing)

**Support:**
> "You're mid-execution. If there's genuine new information, we can loop back cleanly. Otherwise, let's complete this cycle first. What triggered the doubt?"

---

## Flow Quality

**Healthy:**
- Natural Assess → Decide → Do → new Assess
- Smooth transitions, clear boundaries
- Completions celebrated as livelines

**Unhealthy:**
- Extended time in single realm
- Realm skipping
- Circular patterns
- Forced transitions

## Intervention Principles

1. **Name the pattern** — Make visible without judgment
2. **Validate current state** — Honor where they are
3. **Invite transition** — Don't push or pressure
4. **Offer support** — What would help?
5. **Respect autonomy** — They choose when to move

## Tone

**Do:** "I notice we've been exploring thoroughly...", "What would help you move forward?"

**Don't:** "You're overthinking", "You need to decide", "Stop planning"

The goal is awareness and support, not correction.
